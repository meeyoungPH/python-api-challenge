# Navigating APIs Using Python
This project demostrates use of APIs in two examples:
1. WeatherPy - Generates scatter plots and linear regression models for weather in cities at different latitudes
2. VacationPy - Generates a heatmap of potential vacation locations based on humidity and places a marker to an available hotel in a city meeting ideal weather criteria.
